The workshop on creating custom string functions provided an opportunity to understand the inner workings of string manipulation. The process of implementing functions like strcmp, 
strcpy, and strcat helped in identifying their underlying logic. Storing the return value of strcmp in a variable and using a flag to terminate loops when conditions are met were 
important aspects of the implementation. Recognizing the need for null-termination in strings was also important for functions like strcpy and strcat. However, the strstr function 
proved to be more challenging, requiring careful consideration of necessary functions and conditions. Overall, the workshop helped me to understand that strings always end with a null 
value and that string functions operate until it is encountering this null value. Exploring the usage of nullptr, ASCII codes, and accessing array elements by address were additional 
valuable lessons from the workshop.
