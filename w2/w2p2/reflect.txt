Through this workshop, I was able to understand the use of dynamic memory in C++. Using of dynamic memory allocation 
is a waste of memory if the input is lesser than the declared size. Thus, using of new memory allocation eliminates
 memory waste. It is also important to add an extra space after the string size for the null terminator. It is also 
important to deallocate memory using delete or else it might cause a memory leak. Also, when deleting memory, it is 
necessary to delete the memory in the reverse order of the order in which it was initially allocated. Overload occurs 
when several functions use the same name as each other. This is possible in C++ because the compiler of C++ determines
 that the functions are different if they have different parameters, even if they have the same name. In this workshop 
I had to implement many overload functions. I used parameters like "bool load(Employee& emp)". I used outside parameters
 rather than inside parameters (passed through a reference or pointer). When a parameter is received as an outside
 parameter, the function can be used by copying the value of the parameter, as well as overwriting the value of the parameter.
 This is due to direct access to the addresses of the parameters. Inside parameters keeps the value from being modified by using
 the keyword “const”.
