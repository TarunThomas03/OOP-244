I was able to learn how to interact with objects in the object-oriented language C++ during this course.I can create my first object using a class. 
It is possible for it to contain variables and functions, sometimes known as member variables and member functions. Using the private and public 
keywords, I can also define their scope. By default, it is designated private, but if the scope is changed to public, it can be accessed from both 
inside and outside the class. I utilised the member functions as a query or modify mechanism in this workshop. A query function is a function that 
uses a role like const to stop an object's state from changing. For example, the constant void display(). The member variable's value, however, can
 be altered with the modify function. For example, I might assign the input value to a member variable or make the member variable empty. If you want
 to access a member variable that has been publicly disclosed from outside the programme, use the symbol "." In this workshop, I was also able to use
 a few of the member functions of iosream using cout. These member features were accessible to the general public and could be accessed through "."
 When creating a table with a clean format, the functions setf, width, fill, and unsetf are helpful. The alignment or format is decided by the sets 
set and unsetf. For example, cout.setf (ios::fixed), which holds the format, or cout.setf (ios::left), which is left alignment. Additionally, I can 
set the spacing using the width. The empty space can also be filled with the desired characters up to the size I set with width by using the fill 
command. Finally, it is necessary to release the alignment or format marked as unsetf.  Last but not least, the precision can also be used to
 calculate the decimal places.
